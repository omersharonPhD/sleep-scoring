   ABSTRACT={We introduce Sleep, a new Python open-source graphical user interface (GUI) dedicated to visualization, scoring and analyses of sleep data. Among its most prominent features are: 1) Dynamic display of polysomnographic data, spectrogram, hypnogram and topographic maps with several customizable parameters, 2) Implementation of several automatic detection of sleep features such as spindles, K-complexes, slow waves and rapid eye movements, 3) Implementation of practical signal processing tools such as re-referencing or filtering, and 4) Display of main descriptive statistics including publication-ready tables and figures.  The software package supports loading and reading raw EEG data from a standard file formats such as European Data Format, in addition to a range of commercial data formats. Most importantly, Sleep is built on top of the VisPy library, which provides GPU-based fast and high-level visualization. As a result, it is capable of efficiently handling and displaying large sleep datasets. Sleep is freely available (http://visbrain.org/sleep) and comes with sample datasets and an extensive documentation. Novel functionalities will continue to be added and open-science community efforts are expected to enhance the capacities of this module.}
